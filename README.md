# WhatsCookingApp Overview
This application was part inspired by given projects and part inspired by a problem that my wife and I face constantly. We never know what to make! We never know what we can make. I thought that this problem could be pretty widespread and so I thought this application was a good potential product for the future. This product aims in providing the answers to those questions that arise at meal times. What are we going to have? What can we make? 

The application is a web app built using node.js and react as the backend, webpack as the package organizer, tailwind as the styling stack, and typescript and html as the coding languages (although they are tsx files, "files specifically tailored for writing React components and JSX syntax" in typescript). TSX or typescript jsx files help better manage the typing of data and insure that the correct allowed data types are getting through and nothing else. This really shined as this application used an API that returned specific data. Typescript allowed the perfect manipulation through the use of interfaces. 

The software acts as a search engine. A user is given a text box in which they give ingredients, or meal ideas that they have and a call is made to an api which returns "hits" of the given keywords. If someone searches "Breakfast", then breakfast meals will be returned. If someone searches rice, then meals involving rice or recipes involving the methods of cooking rice will be returned. Users are also then given the chance to save favorite recipes for future use. The project as a whole acts as a product that many could use in their daily life to help ease cooking problems and questions.
